# 3D Printed Jewellery

I worked on this project with my wife Gabbi, who's business Humble & Maker make craft and sewing kits. I designed some 3D printed jewellery which we filled with the small sections of felt fabric leftover from these kits. At the time I hadn't seen anyone else using 3D printed jewellery which also incorporated fabric.
